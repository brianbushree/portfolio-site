# portfolio-site
This is my [portfolio site.](http://bbushree.pythonanywhere.com/)

It is currently a work in progress but the coolest feature is that I've created it as dynamic application that looks for projects within given direcotries and builds components using the files provided.

Meaning, to add a new project to a category I can simply create a file containing some information about the project and copy the new project directory to the code/ directory.
